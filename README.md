# Admin-Dashboard
A project from The Odin Project to get more comfortable with using CSS Grid. This will be a mock-up of an Admin Dashboard with no functionality. The goal is to use grid for the layout and nesting child elements to also use grid. 

Flexbox would probably make sense in some sections, but this in an exercise in using grid only.
